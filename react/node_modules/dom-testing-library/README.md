## The problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your Web UI. As a part of
this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of
your components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence
for which they are intended. As part of this, you want your testbase to be
maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to
implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and
your team down.

## This solution

The `dom-testing-library` is a very light-weight solution for testing DOM nodes
(whether simulated with [`JSDOM`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) as provided by
default with [jest][] or in the browser). The main utilities it provides involve
querying the DOM for nodes in a way that's similar to how the user finds
elements on the page. In this way, the library helps ensure your tests give you
confidence in your UI code. The `dom-testing-library`'s primary guiding
principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.][guiding-principle]

As part of this goal, the utilities this library provides facilitate querying
the DOM in the same way the user would. Finding for elements by their label text
(just like a user would), finding links and buttons from their text
(like a user would), and more. It also exposes a recommended way to find
elements by a `data-testid` as an "escape hatch" for elements where the text
content and label do not make sense or is not practical.

This library encourages your applications to be more accessible and allows you
to get your tests closer to using your components the way a user will, which
allows your tests to give you more confidence that your application will work
when a real user uses it.

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework
2.  Specific to a testing framework (though we recommend Jest as our
    preference, the library works with any framework)

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev dom-testing-library
```

## Usage

Note: each of the `get` APIs below have a matching [`getAll`](#queryall-and-getall-apis) API that returns all elements instead of just the first one, and [`query`](#query-apis)/[`getAll`](#queryall-and-getall-apis) that return `null`/`[]` instead of throwing an error.

```javascript
// src/__tests__/example.js
// query utilities:
import {
  getByLabelText,
  getByText,
  getByTestId,
  queryByTestId,
  // Tip: all queries are also exposed on an object
  // called "queries" which you could import here as well
  wait,
} from 'dom-testing-library'
// adds special assertions like toHaveTextContent and toBeInTheDOM
import 'dom-testing-library/extend-expect'

function getExampleDOM() {
  // This is just a raw example of setting up some DOM
  // that we can interact with. Swap this with your UI
  // framework of choice üòâ
  const div = document.createElement('div')
  div.innerHTML = `
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input id="username" />
    <button>Print Username</button>
  `
  const button = div.querySelector('button')
  const input = div.querySelector('input')
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // let's pretend this is making a server request, so it's async
    // (you'd want to mock this imaginary request in your unit tests)...
    setTimeout(() => {
      const printedUsernameContainer = document.createElement('div')
      printedUsernameContainer.innerHTML = `
        <div data-testid="printed-username">${input.value}</div>
      `
      div.appendChild(printedUsernameContainer)
    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200))
  })
  return div
}

test('examples of some things', async () => {
  const famousWomanInHistory = 'Ada Lovelace'
  const container = getExampleDOM()

  // Get form elements by their label text.
  // An error will be thrown if one cannot be found (accessibility FTW!)
  const input = getByLabelText(container, 'Username')
  input.value = famousWomanInHistory

  // Get elements by their text, just like a real user does.
  getByText(container, 'Print Username').click()

  await wait(() =>
    expect(queryByTestId(container, 'printed-username')).toBeInTheDOM(),
  )

  // getByTestId and queryByTestId are an escape hatch to get elements
  // by a test id (could also attempt to get this element by it's text)
  expect(getByTestId(container, 'printed-username')).toHaveTextContent(
    famousWomanInHistory,
  )
  // jest snapshots work great with regular DOM nodes!
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

### `getByLabelText(container: HTMLElement, text: TextMatch, options: {selector: string = '*'}): HTMLElement`

This will search for the label that matches the given [`TextMatch`](#textmatch),
then find the element associated with that label.

```javascript
const inputNode = getByLabelText(container, 'Username')

// this would find the input node for the following DOM structures:
// The "for" attribute (NOTE: in JSX with React you'll write "htmlFor" rather than "for")
// <label for="username-input">Username</label>
// <input id="username-input" />
//
// The aria-labelledby attribute
// <label id="username-label">Username</label>
// <input aria-labelledby="username-label" />
//
// Wrapper labels
// <label>Username <input /></label>
//
// It will NOT find the input node for this:
// <label><span>Username</span> <input /></label>
//
// For this case, you can provide a `selector` in the options:
const inputNode = getByLabelText(container, 'username', {selector: 'input'})
// and that would work
// Note that <input aria-label="username" /> will also work, but take
// care because this is not a label that users can see on the page. So
// the purpose of your input should be obvious for those users.
```

> Note: This method will throw an error if it cannot find the node. If you don't
> want this behavior (for example you wish to assert that it doesn't exist),
> then use `queryByLabelText` instead.

### `getByPlaceholderText(container: HTMLElement, text: TextMatch): HTMLElement`

This will search for all elements with a placeholder attribute and find one
that matches the given [`TextMatch`](#textmatch).

```javascript
// <input placeholder="Username" />
const inputNode = getByPlaceholderText(container, 'Username')
```

> NOTE: a placeholder is not a good substitute for a label so you should
> generally use `getByLabelText` instead.

### `getByText(container: HTMLElement, text: TextMatch): HTMLElement`

This will search for all elements that have a text node with `textContent`
matching the given [`TextMatch`](#textmatch).

```javascript
// <a href="/about">About ‚ÑπÔ∏è</a>
const aboutAnchorNode = getByText(container, 'about')
```

### `getByAltText(container: HTMLElement, text: TextMatch): HTMLElement`

This will return the element (normally an `<img>`) that has the given `alt`
text. Note that it only supports elements which accept an `alt` attribute:
[`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img),
[`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input),
and [`<area>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area)
(intentionally excluding [`<applet>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/applet) as it's deprecated).

```javascript
// <img alt="Incredibles 2 Poster" src="/incredibles-2.png" />
const incrediblesPosterImg = getByAltText(container, /incredibles.*poster$/i)
```

### `getByTitle(container: HTMLElement, title: ExactTextMatch): HTMLElement`

This will return the element that has the matching `title` attribute.

```javascript
// <span title="Delete" id="2" />
const deleteElement = getByTitle(container, 'Delete')
```

### `getByTestId(container: HTMLElement, text: ExactTextMatch): HTMLElement`

A shortcut to `` container.querySelector(`[data-testid="${yourId}"]`) `` (and it
also accepts an [`ExactTextMatch`](#exacttextmatch)).

```javascript
// <input data-testid="username-input" />
const usernameInputElement = getByTestId(container, 'username-input')
```

> In the spirit of [the guiding principles](#guiding-principles), it is
> recommended to use this only after the other queries don't work for your use
> case. Using data-testid attributes do not resemble how your software is used
> and should be avoided if possible. That said, they are _way_ better than
> querying based on DOM structure or styling css class names. Learn more about
> `data-testid`s from the blog post
> ["Making your UI tests resilient to change"][data-testid-blog-post]

### `wait`

Defined as:

```typescript
function wait(
  callback?: () => void,
  options?: {
    timeout?: number
    interval?: number
  },
): Promise<void>
```

When in need to wait for non-deterministic periods of time you can use `wait`,
to wait for your expectations to pass. The `wait` function is a small wrapper
around the
[`wait-for-expect`](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/wait-for-expect) module.
Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// ...
// Wait until the callback does not throw an error. In this case, that means
// it'll wait until we can get a form control with a label that matches "username".
await wait(() => getByLabelText(container, 'username'))
getByLabelText(container, 'username').value = 'chucknorris'
// ...
```

This can be useful if you have a unit test that mocks API calls and you need
to wait for your mock promises to all resolve.

The default `callback` is a no-op function (used like `await wait()`). This can
be helpful if you only need to wait for one tick of the event loop (in the case
of mocked API calls with promises that resolve immediately).

The default `timeout` is `4500ms` which will keep you under
[Jest's default timeout of `5000ms`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/jest-object.html#jestsettimeouttimeout).

The default `interval` is `50ms`. However it will run your callback immediately
on the next tick of the event loop (in a `setTimeout`) before starting the
intervals.

### `waitForElement`

Defined as:

```typescript
function waitForElement<T>(
  callback?: () => T | null | undefined,
  options?: {
    container?: HTMLElement
    timeout?: number
    mutationObserverOptions?: MutationObserverInit
  },
): Promise<T>
```

When in need to wait for DOM elements to appear, disappear, or change you can use `waitForElement`.
The `waitForElement` function is a small wrapper
around the
[`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver).
Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// ...
// Wait until the callback does not throw an error and returns a truthy value. In this case, that means
// it'll wait until we can get a form control with a label that matches "username".
// The difference from `wait` is that rather than running your callback on
// an interval, it's run as soon as there are DOM changes in the container
// and returns the value returned by the callback.
const usernameElement = await waitForElement(
  () => getByLabelText(container, 'username'),
  {container},
)
usernameElement.value = 'chucknorris'
// ...
```

You can also wait for multiple elements at once:

```javascript
const [usernameElement, passwordElement] = waitForElement(
  () => [
    getByLabelText(container, 'username'),
    getByLabelText(container, 'password'),
  ],
  {container},
)
```

Using [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) is more efficient than polling the DOM at regular intervals with `wait`. This library sets up a [`'mutationobserver-shim'`](https://github.com/megawac/MutationObserver.js) on the global `window` object for cross-platform compatibility with older browsers and the [`jsdom`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/639) that is usually used in Node-based tests.

The default `callback` is a no-op function (used like `await waitForElement()`). This can
be helpful if you only need to wait for the next DOM change (see [`mutationObserverOptions`](#mutationobserveroptions) to learn which changes are detected).

The default `container` is the global `document`. Make sure the elements you wait for will be attached to it, or set a different `container`.

The default `timeout` is `4500ms` which will keep you under
[Jest's default timeout of `5000ms`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/jest-object.html#jestsettimeouttimeout).

<a name="mutationobserveroptions"></a>The default `mutationObserverOptions` is `{subtree: true, childList: true}` which will detect
additions and removals of child elements (including text nodes) in the `container` and any of its descendants.
It won't detect attribute changes unless you add `attributes: true` to the options.

### `fireEvent(node: HTMLElement, event: Event)`

Fire DOM events.

```javascript
// <button>Submit</button>
fireEvent(
  getByText(container, 'Submit'),
  new MouseEvent('click', {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
  }),
)
```

#### `fireEvent[eventName](node: HTMLElement, eventProperties: Object)`

Convenience methods for firing DOM events. Check out
[src/events.js](https://github.com/kentcdodds/dom-testing-library/blob/master/src/events.js)
for a full list as well as default `eventProperties`.

```javascript
// <button>Submit</button>
const rightClick = {button: 2}
fireEvent.click(getElementByText('Submit'), rightClick)
// default `button` property for click events is set to `0` which is a left click.
```

#### `getNodeText(node: HTMLElement)`

Returns the complete text content of a html element, removing any extra
whitespace. The intention is to treat text in nodes exactly as how it is
perceived by users in a browser, where any extra whitespace within words in the
html code is not meaningful when the text is rendered.

```javascript
// <div>
//   Hello
//     World  !
// </div>
const text = getNodeText(container.querySelector('div')) // "Hello World !"
```

This function is also used internally when querying nodes by their text content.
This enables functions like `getByText` and `queryByText` to work as expected,
finding elements in the DOM similarly to how users would do.

## Custom Jest Matchers

When using [jest][], we recommend that you import a set of custom matchers that
make it easier to check several aspects of the state of a DOM element. These are
provided by [jest-dom](https://github.com/gnapse/jest-dom), but are also
included for convenience to be imported from this library directly:

```javascript
import 'dom-testing-library/extend-expect'

// <span data-testid="greetings">Hello World</span>
expect(queryByText(container, 'greetings')).toBeInTheDOM()
expect(queryByText(container, 'greetings')).not.toHaveTextContent('Bye bye')
// ...

> Note: when using `toBeInTheDOM`, make sure you use a query function
> (like `queryByTestId`) rather than a get function (like `getByTestId`).
> Otherwise the `get*` function could throw an error before your assertion.
```

Check out [jest-dom's documentation](https://github.com/gnapse/jest-dom#readme)
for a full list of available matchers.

### Using other assertion libraries

If you're not using jest, you may be able to find a similar set of custom
assertions for your library of choice. Here's a list of alternatives to jest-dom
for other popular assertion libraries:

* [chai-dom](https://github.com/nathanboktae/chai-dom)

If you're aware of some other alternatives, please [make a pull request][prs]
and add it here!

## `TextMatch`

Several APIs accept a `TextMatch` which can be a `string`, `regex` or a
`function` which returns `true` for a match and `false` for a mismatch.

Here's an example

```javascript
// <div>Hello World</div>
// all of the following will find the div
getByText(container, 'Hello World') // full match
getByText(container, 'llo worl') // substring match
getByText(container, 'hello world') // strings ignore case
getByText(container, /Hello W?oRlD/i) // regex
getByText(container, (content, element) => content.startsWith('Hello')) // function

// all of the following will NOT find the div
getByText(container, 'Goodbye World') // non-string match
getByText(container, /hello world/) // case-sensitive regex with different case
// function looking for a span when it's actually a div
getByText(container, (content, element) => {
  return element.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'span' && content.startsWith('Hello')
})
```

### ExactTextMatch

Some APIs use ExactTextMatch, which is the same as TextMatch but case-sensitive
and does not match substrings; however, regexes and functions are also accepted
for custom matching.

```js
// <button data-testid="submit-button">Go</button>

// all of the following will find the button
getByTestId(container, 'submit-button') // exact match
getByTestId(container, /submit*/) // regex match
getByTestId(container, content => content.startsWith('submit')) // function

// all of the following will NOT find the button
getByTestId(container, 'submit-') // no substrings
getByTestId(container, 'Submit-Button') // case-sensitive
```

## `query` APIs

Each of the `get` APIs listed in [the 'Usage'](#usage) section above have a
complimentary `query` API. The `get` APIs will throw errors if a proper node
cannot be found. This is normally the desired effect. However, if you want to
make an assertion that an element is _not_ present in the DOM, then you can use
the `query` API instead:

```javascript
const submitButton = queryByText(container, 'submit')
expect(submitButton).toBeNull() // it doesn't exist
// or if you're using the custom matchers:
expect(submitButton).not.toBeInTheDOM()
```

## `queryAll` and `getAll` APIs

Each of the `query` APIs have a corresponsing `queryAll` version that always returns an Array of matching nodes. `getAll` is the same but throws when the array has a length of 0.

```javascript
const submitButtons = queryAllByText(container, 'submit')
expect(submitButtons).toHaveLength(3) // expect 3 elements
expect(submitButtons[0]).toBeInTheDOM()
```

## `bindElementToQueries`

`bindElementToQueries` takes a DOM element and binds it to the raw query functions, allowing them
to be used without specifying a container. It is the recommended approach for libraries built on this API
and is in use in `react-testing-library` and `vue-testing-library`.

## Debugging

When you use any `get` calls in your test cases, the current state of the `container`
(DOM) gets printed on the console. For example:

```javascript
// <div>Hello world</div>
getByText(container, 'Goodbye world') // will fail by throwing error
```

The above test case will fail, however it prints the state of your DOM under test,
so you will get to see:

```
Unable to find an element with the text: Goodbye world. This could be because the text is broken up by multiple elements. In this case, you can provide a function for your text matcher to make your matcher more flexible.
Here is the state of your container:
<div>
  <div>
    Hello World!
  </div>
</div>
```

Note: Since the DOM size can get really large, you can set the limit of DOM content
to be printed via environment variable `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT`. The default value is
`7000`. You will see `...` in the console, when the DOM content is stripped off,
because of the length you have set or due to default size limit. Here's how you
might increase this limit when running tests:

```
DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT=10000 npm test
```

This works on macOS/linux, you'll need to do something else for windows. If you'd
like a solution that works for both, see [`cross-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env)

### `prettyDOM`

This helper function can be used to print out readable representation of the DOM
tree of a node. This can be helpful for instance when debugging tests.

It is defined as:

```typescript
function prettyDOM(node: HTMLElement, maxLength?: number): string
```

It receives the root node to print out, and an optional extra argument to limit
the size of the resulting string, for cases when it becomes too large.

This function is usually used alongside `console.log` to temporarily print out
DOM trees during tests for debugging purposes:

```javascript
const div = document.createElement('div')
div.innerHTML = '<div><h1>Hello World</h1></div>'
console.log(prettyDOM(div))
// <div>
//   <h1>Hello World</h1>
// </div>
```

This function is what also powers [the automatic debugging output described above](#debugging).

## Implementations

This library was not built to be used on its own. The original implementation
of these utilities was in the `react-testing-library`.

Implementations include:

* [`react-testing-library`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>Which get method should I use?</summary>

Based on [the Guiding Principles](#guiding-principles), your test should
resemble how your code (component, page, etc.) as much as possible. With this
in mind, we recommend this order of priority:

1.  `getByLabelText`: Only really good for form fields, but this is the number 1
    method a user finds those elements, so it should be your top preference.
2.  `getByPlaceholderText`: [A placeholder is not a substitute for a label](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/).
    But if that's all you have, then it's better than alternatives.
3.  `getByText`: Not useful for forms, but this is the number 1 method a user
    finds other elements (like buttons to click), so it should be your top
    preference for non-form elements.
4.  `getByAltText`: If your element is one which supports `alt` text
    (`img`, `area`, and `input`), then you can use this to find that element.
5.  `getByTestId`: The user cannot see (or hear) these, so this is only
    recommended for cases where you can't match by text or it doesn't make sense
    (the text is dynamic).

Other than that, you can also use the `container` to query the rendered
component as well (using the regular
[`querySelector` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I write unit tests with this library?</summary>

Definitely yes! You can write unit, integration, functional, and end-to-end
tests with this library.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if my app is localized and I don't have access to the text in test?</summary>

This is fairly common. Our first bit of advice is to try to get the default
text used in your tests. That will make everything much easier (more than just
using this utility). If that's not possible, then you're probably best
to just stick with `data-testid`s (which is not too bad anyway).

</details>

<details>

<summary>I really don't like data-testids, but none of the other queries make sense. Do I have to use a data-testid?</summary>

Definitely not. That said, a common reason people don't like the `data-testid`
attribute is they're concerned about shipping that to production. I'd suggest
that you probably want some simple E2E tests that run in production on occasion
to make certain that things are working smoothly. In that case the `data-testid`
attributes will be very useful. Even if you don't run these in production, you
may want to run some E2E tests that run on the same code you're about to ship to
production. In that case, the `data-testid` attributes will be valuable there as
well.

All that said, if you really don't want to ship `data-testid` attributes, then you
can use
[this simple babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-remove-properties)
to remove them.

If you don't want to use them at all, then you can simply use regular DOM
methods and properties to query elements off your container.

```javascript
const firstLiInDiv = container.querySelector('div li')
const allLisInDiv = container.querySelectorAll('div li')
const rootElement = container.firstChild
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if I‚Äôm iterating over a list of items that I want to put the data-testid="item" attribute on. How do I distinguish them from each other?</summary>

You can make your selector just choose the one you want by including :nth-child in the selector.

```javascript
const thirdLiInUl = container.querySelector('ul > li:nth-child(3)')
```

Or you could include the index or an ID in your attribute:

```javascript
;`<li data-testid="item-${item.id}">{item.text}</li>`
```

And then you could use the `getByTestId` utility:

```javascript
const items = [
  /* your items */
]
const container = render(/* however you render this stuff */)
const thirdItem = getByTestId(container, `item-${items[2].id}`)
```

</details>

## Guiding Principles

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.][guiding-principle]

We try to only expose methods and utilities that encourage you to write tests
that closely resemble how your web pages are used.

Utilities are included in this project based on the following guiding
principles:

1.  If it relates to rendering components, it deals with DOM nodes rather than
    component instances, nor should it encourage dealing with component
    instances.
2.  It should be generally useful for testing the application components in the
    way the user would use it. We _are_ making some trade-offs here because
    we're using a computer and often a simulated browser environment, but in
    general, utilities should encourage tests that use the components the way
    they're intended to be used.
3.  Utility implementations and APIs should be simple and flexible.

At the end of the day, what we want is for this library to be pretty
light-weight, simple, and understandable.
